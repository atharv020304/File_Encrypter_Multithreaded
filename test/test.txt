One of the greatest achievements in space exploration was the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. This historic event marked the first time humans set foot on another celestial body. Neil Armstrong’s iconic words, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” still resonate as a testament to human ingenuity and determination.

Beyond scientific discoveries, space exploration has driven innovation in technology. Satellite systems enable global communication, navigation, and weather forecasting. Moreover, advancements in materials science, robotics, and artificial intelligence often originate from challenges posed by space missions.
